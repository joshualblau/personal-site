Finding Time
Here I hold my time in hand,
Waiting for a chance to spend
It, currency against the tasks
Waiting, queued in colored masks.

Money limited in flow
Buying streams that never slow
Nor do they stop, show signs of clearing,
Nor away begin they steering.

Night, and still upright I stand
'Fore the vibrant to-do band,
Empty pockets shouting loud
At their holder not endowed.

Satisfied I am despite
Time held tightly taken flight;
Now I have a finished room
Colorful as a plain in bloom.
