My Arm Hair is Stop Motion in the Shower
Droplets fall gently on my arm
Though hard enough to part the even distribution
Of my hair into wavelets that caress the skin
As though prompted by a director taking
Thousands of photographs.

I wonder whether I should maintain that
I am the one taking the photographs when
I am clearly only the one controlling the water, nay,
I only turn it on and off.
